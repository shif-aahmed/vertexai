      "title": "Questions You Should Never Ask an AI Model (And Why)",
      "content": "Artificial intelligence models have evolved into powerful tools, capable of writing code, summarizing complex documents, and generating creative content. However, as with any powerful technology, understanding its limitations is as important as recognizing its capabilities. While an AI model can be a brilliant assistant, it is not an all-knowing oracle or a substitute for human judgment. Understanding these boundaries is essential for effective and responsible AI usage. Here are some questions you should never ask an AI model, along with a clear explanation of why. AI models are not licensed professionals. The information they provide is for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional consultation. The data they are trained on can be out of date, incomplete, or misinterpreted, leading to potentially harmful or incorrect advice. Examples to Avoid: 'What’s the best treatment for my migraine?', 'Is this stock a good investment for me?', 'How should I handle my tax audit?'. AI models are built with strict safety filters and ethical guidelines to prevent them from generating content that could facilitate harm. Asking questions about illegal acts, creating dangerous substances, or engaging in malicious activities will result in a refusal to answer. The purpose of these models is to be helpful and harmless, not to be an accomplice. Examples to Avoid: 'How do I build a bomb?', 'What’s the easiest way to hack a website?', 'Provide a recipe for an explosive device.'. AI models are not designed to store or provide personal information about individuals. They are trained on vast, public datasets, but they do not have access to private data from your personal accounts, emails, or conversations. Attempting to get private information is a privacy violation and a security risk. Examples to Avoid: 'What is my home address?', 'What is my Social Security number?', 'What’s the password to my email account?'. A core tenet of modern AI development is to prevent the generation of hate speech, discriminatory content, and dangerous misinformation. AI models are trained to avoid generating or propagating stereotypes, inciting violence, or spreading false narratives that can harm individuals or groups. Examples to Avoid: Questions that reinforce harmful stereotypes about any race, religion, or gender. Requests to generate content that promotes violence or hate speech. Attempting to bypass the model’s safety filters—often called 'jailbreaking'—is a violation of its intended use. These models are continuously monitored and updated to close such loopholes. This practice is counterproductive and can lead to a less helpful and safe model for everyone. Most AI models have a knowledge cutoff date, meaning their understanding of events is limited to when their training data was collected. They also cannot predict the future. Asking about the winner of a sports game that just finished or the outcome of a future stock market trend will likely lead to an incorrect or fabricated answer, a phenomenon known as 'hallucination.'. The future of AI is bright, but it depends on a shared commitment to using this technology responsibly. By avoiding these types of questions, you not only contribute to a safer and more ethical AI ecosystem but also improve your own experience with these models. An AI model is a powerful and valuable tool, but it is not a replacement for human expertise, judgment, or common sense."
